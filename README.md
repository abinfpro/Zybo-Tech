This project is a mini e-commerce application built using Next.js (App Router) as part of a machine test. To set up the project locally, clone the repository and install dependencies using npm install. Create a .env.local file and configure the backend API base URL. Start the development server with npm run dev and access the application at http://localhost:3000.

The application uses server-side rendering (SSR) for the Navbar, Product pages, and Footer, GSAP for mandatory hover animations, and JWT-based authentication with OTP login. API communication is handled via Next.js Route Handlers acting as a proxy layer to securely attach authentication tokens. State management is implemented using Context API or Zustand to manage authentication and user data. The codebase follows clean architecture and production-ready practices as required for evaluation.
